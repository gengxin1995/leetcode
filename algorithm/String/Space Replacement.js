/**
 * Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with %20 . The string is given in a characters array, you can assume it has enough space for replacement and you are given the true length of the string.
 * You code should also return the new length of the string after replacement.
 *
 * Notice
 * If you are using Java or Pythonï¼Œ please use characters array instead of string.
 *
 * Example
 * Given "Mr John Smith" , length = 13 .
 * The string after replacement should be "Mr%20John%20Smith" , you need to change the string in-place and return the new length 17 .
 *
 * Challenge
 * Do it in-place.
